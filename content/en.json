  "intro": "An emerging team with plans to establish insanONE in Abu Dhabi — creating a clear, intelligent HR and payroll platform for modern organisations. We aim to keep complexity out and confidence in.",
  "whoTitle": "Who we are",
  "whoBody": "insanONE will be developed to make the management of people and pay straightforward again. Built specifically for the UAE, it will reflect local labour law, language, and reporting requirements from the outset — with a data model and architecture designed to support future growth across the wider GCC once established.",
  "executionTitle": "How we’ll build it",
  "executionBody": "The platform will connect HR, payroll, and compliance through a single, structured data model that delivers reliable information without extra steps or external dependencies. The emphasis will be on output: information that is complete, consistent, and ready to use. Rather than adding endless configuration options, insanONE will apply strong defaults and clear guidance so every organisation works from the same foundation. Data will be validated automatically as it’s entered, reducing errors and the cost of correction. Reports and metrics will be available instantly — no rebuilds, no specialist queries, no waiting for consultants.",
  "usabilityTitle": "Familiar and inclusive by design",
  "usabilityBody": "insanONE is planned to feel familiar from the first click. For too long, HR and payroll systems have expected users to master huge manuals and extensive training just to perform everyday tasks. insanONE will apply the same design logic people already trust in daily life — clear navigation, predictable actions, and feedback that makes sense. HR and payroll teams will still benefit from detailed training, but the system itself will be intuitive and largely self-explanatory. The platform will be bilingual in English and Arabic and built to modern accessibility standards. Its interface will be simple, responsive, and inclusive, supporting every user — whether in HR, finance, or leadership — to find what they need quickly and confidently.",
  "geoTitle": "UAE first → GCC next",
  "geoBody": "insanONE will be built for the UAE from the outset — labour law, language, and reporting. Once established and proven, the architecture is intended to support expansion across the wider GCC with the same clarity and consistency.",
